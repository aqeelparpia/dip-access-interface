## Overview

SCOPE is a Django project designed to provide access to Dissemination Information Packages (i.e., access copies of digital files stored in Archival Information Packages in CCA's Archivematica-based digital repository). The project is specifically designed around the custom DIPs generated by [create-dip.py](https://github.com/artefactual/automation-tools/blob/master/aips/create_dip.py) via Artefactual's [Automation Tools](https://github.com/artefactual/automation-tools).

The primary application, "dips", allows users to add, organize, and interact with these DIPs and the digital files they contain, depending on user permissions.  

See the [user stories](https://github.com/CCA-Public/dip-access-interface/wiki/User-Stories) for background on current and future features.

See the [user manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjmQSLCZGvmc05DfIs0XQn_60_DLwxGH-aF7-4R_zmQ/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on how to use SCOPE.

## Data model

The application organizes and displays information in several levels:

* **Collection**: A Collection is the highest level of organization and corresponds to an archive or other assembled collection of materials. A Collection has 0 to many Folders as children (in practice, every collection should have at least one child, but this is not enforced by the application). Collections may also have unqualified Dublin Core descriptive metadata, as well as a link to a finding aid.
* **Folder**: A Folder corresponds 1:1 with a Dissemination Information Package (DIP). A Folder has 1 to many Digital Files as children, which are auto-generated from information in the AIP METS file included as part of the CCA-style DIP. Folders may also have unqualified Dublin Core metadata. The DC metadata from the most recently updated dmdSec is written into the Folder record when the METS file is uploaded (except "ispartof", which is hard-coded on creation of the Folder. This might be something to change for more generalized usage).
* **Digital File**: A Digital File corresponds to a description of an original digital file in the AIP METS file and contains detailed metadata from an AIP METS file amdSec, including a list of PREMIS events. Digital Files should never be created manually, but only generated via parsing of the METS file when a new Folder is added.

## Uploading new DIPs

When a sufficiently privileged user creates a new Folder through the GUI interface, they need only enter the identifier, choose the Collection to which the Folder belongs, and upload a copy of the zipped digital objects from the CCA-style DIP to upload. The application then uses the `parsemets.py` script to parse the AIP METS file included in the DIP, automatically:

* Saving Dublin Core metadata found in the (most recently updated) dmdSec to the DIP model object for the Folder
* Generating records for Digital Files and the PREMIS events associated with each digital file and saving them to the database.

In a future version of the application, it should be possible to upload a new DIP via a (not yet existing) REST API, which will similarly populate the database from the METS file.

Once the DIP has been uploaded, the metadata for the Folder can be edited through the GUI by any user with sufficient permissions.

## User types and permissions

By default, the application has five levels of permissions:

* **Administrators**: Administrators have access to all parts of the application.
* **Managers**: Users in this group can manage users but not make them administrators.
* **Editors**: Users in this group can add and edit Collections and Folders but not delete them.
* **Public**: Users with a username/password but no additional permissions have view-only access.
* **Unauthenticated**: Not logged in users can only access the FAQ and login pages.

For more information check the [user management and permissions feature file](features/user_management_and_permissions.feature).

## Technologies involved

SCOPE is a Django application that uses Elasticsearch 6.x as search engine, Celery 4.2 to process asynchronous tasks, a SQLite database and Redis as message broker (probably in the future, as cache system too).

### Django, Celery and SQLite

The Django application and the Celery worker need access to the source code, the database and the stored ZIP files. To avoid complexity and because the application currently uses SQLite as the database engine, it’s recommended to have both components running on the same machine.

The application is ready to be served with Gunicorn and Gevent, using WhiteNoise to serve the static files and Nginx, to proxy the application and serve the uploaded ZIP files. Check the install notes below for more information. Gunicorn is deployed using the Gevent worker class, meaning that a single worker should scale sufficiently even during I/O-bound operations like serving static files. If there are more CPU-bound tasks needed in the future, those will be delegated to the Celery async. task queue to ensure that the event loop is not blocked; therefore, the recommended amount of workers deployed is one.

Large file uploads (+2.5 megabytes) are saved in the OS temporary directory and deleted at the end of the request by Django and, using SQLite as the database engine, the memory requirements should be really low for this part of the application. Some notes about SQLite memory management in [this page](https://www2.sqlite.org/sysreq.html) (from S30000 to S30500).

The amount of Celery workers deployed to handle asynchronous tasks could vary, as well as the pool size for each worker, check [the Celery concurrency documentation](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#concurrency). However, to reduce the possibility of simultaneous writes to the SQLite database, we suggest to use a single worker with a concurrency of one. Currently, the application only includes a task to extract and parse the METS file, until a better parsing process is developed, the entire METS file is being hold in memory and, for that reason, the amount of memory needed for this part of the application should be around: (workers * concurrency * biggest METS file size expected). The METS file will also be extracted in the OS temporary directory during the process, so the disk capacity should also meet the same requirement.

At this point, the application stores the uploaded ZIP files in the "media" folder at the application location. This should be considered to determine the disk capacity needed to hold the application data; in addition to the SQLite database, the space needed for the METS files extraction (mentioned above) and around 200 megabytes to hold the source code and Python dependencies.

### Redis

Redis is used as broker in the current Celery implementation and it will probably be used as cache system in the future. This component could be installed in the same or a different server and its URL can be configured through an environment variable read in the Django settings. At this point the memory footprint, the CPU usage and the disk allocation needed for snapshots will be minimal. Check [the Redis FAQ page](https://redis.io/topics/faq) for more information.

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch could also be installed in the same or different servers and its URL(s) can be configured through an environment variable read in the Django settings. The application expects Elasticsearch 6.x, which requires at least Java 8 in order to run. Only Oracle’s Java and the OpenJDK are supported and the same JVM version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.

The Elasticsearch node/cluster configuration can be fully customized, however, for the current implementation, a single node with the the default JVM heap size of 1GB set by Elasticsearch would be more than enough. It could even be reduced to 512MB if more memory is needed for other parts of the application or to reduce its requirements. For more info on how to change the Elasticsearch configuration check [their documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html), specially [the JVM heap size page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/heap-size.html).

The Elasticsearch indexes size will vary based on the application data and they will require some disk space, but it’s hard to tell how much at this point.

## Recommended system requirements

* Processor, 2 CPU cores.
* Memory, 2GB:
  - 1GB JVM heap size.
  - Biggest METS file size expected.
  - Other services (Nginx, Redis)
* Disk space, the sum of:
  - ~1GB for source code, dependencies and needed services.
  - ~1GB for SQLite database and Elasticsearch data (to be revised as data grows).
  - Biggest ZIP file size expected.
  - Biggest METS file size expected.
  - Total ZIP storage size.

## Installation

The following steps are just an example of how to run the application in a production environment, with all the services involved sharing the same machine, over Ubuntu 16.04.

### Requirements

* Python 3.4 or higher
* Elasticsearch 6.x
* Redis

### Environment

The following environment variables are used to run the application:

* `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` **[REQUIRED]**: List of host/domain names separated by comma that this instance can serve.
* `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` **[REQUIRED]**: A secret key for this instance, used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.
* `DJANGO_DEBUG`: Boolean that turns on/off debug mode. Never deploy a site into production with it turned on. *Default:* `False`.
* `DJANGO_TIME_ZONE`: Timezone for the instance. E.g.: `America/Montreal`. *Default:* `UTC`.
* `ES_HOSTS` **[REQUIRED]**: List of Elasticsearch hosts separated by comma. RFC-1738 formatted URLs can be used. E.g.: `https://user:secret@host:443/`.
* `ES_TIMEOUT`: Timeout in seconds for Elasticsearch requests. *Default:* `10`.
* `ES_POOL_SIZE`: Elasticsearch requests pool size. *Default:* `10`.
* `ES_INDEXES_SHARDS`: Number of shards for Elasticsearch indexes. *Default:* `1`.
* `ES_INDEXES_REPLICAS`: Number of replicas for Elasticsearch indexes. *Default:* `0`.
* `CELERY_BROKER_URL` **[REQUIRED]**: Redis server URL. E.g.: `redis://hostname:port`.

### Setup

As the root user, install pip, virtualenv and needed libraries:

```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install build-essential gcc gettext python3-dev
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
rm get-pip.py
pip install virtualenv
```

Install Java 8 and Elasticsearch:

```
apt-get install apt-transport-https openjdk-8-jre
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list
apt-get update
apt-get install elasticsearch
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start elasticsearch
systemctl enable elasticsearch
```

Verify Elasticsearch is running:

```
curl -XGET http://localhost:9200

{
  "name" : "ofgAtrJ",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "3h9xSrVlRJmDHgQ8FLnByA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.3.0",
    "build_hash" : "db0d481",
    "build_date" : "2017-02-09T22:05:32.386Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "6.4.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

Intall the Redis server, for example following [this tutorial from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-redis-on-ubuntu-16-04). If you decide to install it in a different server, make sure to check [Redis' security documentation](https://redis.io/topics/security) and include the password into the 'CELERY_BROKER_URL' environment variable, following the `redis://:password@hostname:port/db_number` format. For a better level of persistence set 'appendonly' to `yes` in `/etc/redis/redis.conf` and reset the Redis service (`systemctl restart redis`), check [Redis' persistence documentation](https://redis.io/topics/persistence) for more information.

Create user to own and run the application, log in and make sure you're placed in its home folder:

```
adduser scope
su - scope
cd ~
```

Create an environment file in `~/scope-env`, at least with the required variables, to reference it where it's needed, for example:

```
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=example.com
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=secret_key
ES_HOSTS=localhost:9200
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

Clone the repository and go to its directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/CCA-Public/dip-access-interface
cd dip-access-interface
```

Create a Python virtual environment and install the application requirements:

```
virtualenv venv -p python3  
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Export the environment variables to run the `manage.py` commands:

```
export $(cat ~/scope-env)
```

Create the `media` folder with read and execute permissions for the group:

```
mkdir -p media
chmod 750 media
```

Initialize the database:

```
./manage.py migrate
```

Create search indexes:

```
./manage.py index_data
```

Add a superuser:

```
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the instructions to create a user with full admin rights.

Compile translation files:

```
./manage.py compilemessages
```

Collect and build static files:

```
./manage.py collectstatic
./manage.py compress
```

You can now deactivate the environment and go back to the root session:

```
deactivate && exit
```

### Configure worker

To execute asynchronous tasks, back as the 'root' user, create a systemd service file to run the Celery worker. In `/etc/systemd/system/scope-worker.service`, with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Scope Celery Worker
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=scope
Group=scope
EnvironmentFile=/home/scope/scope-env
Environment=CELERYD_PID_FILE=/home/scope/scope-worker.pid
Environment=CELERYD_LOG_FILE=/home/scope/scope-worker.log
WorkingDirectory=/home/scope/dip-access-interface
ExecStart=/home/scope/dip-access-interface/venv/bin/celery \
            multi start scope-worker -A scope \
            --pidfile=${CELERYD_PID_FILE} \
            --logfile=${CELERYD_LOG_FILE} \
            --loglevel=WARNING
ExecReload=/home/scope/dip-access-interface/venv/bin/celery \
            multi restart scope-worker -A scope \
            --pidfile=${CELERYD_PID_FILE} \
            --logfile=${CELERYD_LOG_FILE} \
            --loglevel=WARNING
ExecStop=/home/scope/dip-access-interface/venv/bin/celery \
            multi stopwait scope-worker \
            --pidfile=${CELERYD_PID_FILE}

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start and enable the service:

```
systemctl start scope-worker
systemctl enable scope-worker
```

To access the service logs, use:

```
journalctl -u scope-worker
```

### Serve

The application requirements install Gunicorn, Gevent and WhiteNoise to serve the application, including the static files. Create a systemd service file to run the Gunicorn daemon in `/etc/systemd/system/scope-gunicorn.service`, with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Scope Gunicorn daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=scope
Group=scope
PrivateTmp=true
PIDFile=/home/scope/scope-gunicorn.pid
EnvironmentFile=/home/scope/scope-env
WorkingDirectory=/home/scope/dip-access-interface
ExecStart=/home/scope/dip-access-interface/venv/bin/gunicorn \
            --access-logfile /dev/null \
            --worker-class gevent \
            --bind unix:/home/scope/scope-gunicorn.sock \
            scope.wsgi:application
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s TERM $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start and enable the service:

```
systemctl start scope-gunicorn
systemctl enable scope-gunicorn
```

To access the service logs, use:

```
journalctl -u scope-gunicorn
```

The Gunicorn service is using an Unix socket to listen for connections and we will use Nginx to proxy the application and to serve the uploaded ZIP files. The `client_max_body_size` and `proxy_read_timeout` values should be changed based on the biggest ZIP file and upload time expected. It should also be used to secure the site, but we won't cover that configuration in this example. Install Nginx and create a configuration file:

```
apt-get install nginx
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/scope
```

With the following configuration:

```
upstream scope {
  server unix:/home/scope/scope-gunicorn.sock;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name example.com;
  client_max_body_size 500M;

  location /media/ {
    internal;
    alias /home/scope/dip-access-interface/media/;
  }

  location / {
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_read_timeout 600s;
    proxy_pass http://scope;
  }
}
```

Link the site configuration to `sites-enabled` and remove the default configuration:

```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/scope /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Verify configuration and restart Nginx service:

```
nginx -t
systemctl restart nginx
```

Make sure that the user running Nginx (usually 'www-data') has access to the media folder and files by adding it to the 'scope' group:

```
usermod -a -G scope www-data
```

Reboot to reflect user changes.

## Development

Requires [Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Clone the repository and go to its directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/CCA-Public/dip-access-interface
cd dip-access-interface
```

Build images, initialize services, etc.:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Initialize database:

```
docker-compose exec scope ./manage.py migrate
```

Create search indexes:

```
docker-compose exec scope ./manage.py index_data
```

Add a superuser:

```
docker-compose exec scope ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the instructions to create a user with full administrator rights.

Compile translation files:

```
docker-compose exec scope ./manage.py compilemessages
```

To maintain the Docker image as small as possible, the build dependencies needed are removed after installing the requirements. Therefore, executing `tox` inside the container will fail installing those requirements. If you don't have Tox installed in the host and need to run the application tests and syntax checks, use one of the following commands to create a one go container to do so:

```
docker run --rm -t -v `pwd`:/src -w /src python:3.6 /bin/bash -c "pip install tox && tox"
docker run --rm -t -v `pwd`:/app omercnet/tox
```

Access the logs:

```
docker-compose logs -f scope elasticsearch nginx
```

To access the application with the default options visit http://localhost:43430 in the browser.
